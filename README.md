## Documentation
 In order to see an example of how to use this SDK we have provided a tutorial for you. Once you have fetched the swift-lasdk-ios package in your project press ``Command + control + shift + d``  and you will build the documentation. Then in the side bar find ``swift-lasdk-ios -> Build an awesome app using LASDKiOS`` and enjoy!


## CBAAssist is a sample app that demonstrates how to implement LASDKiOS which is a framework designed for Co-browsing needs.

**Getting Started**

Please clone the project and then checkout the release of your choice. When you do this, CBAFusion may know which version of LASDKiOS to fetch that works with the corresponding release, if not you will have to fetch via Swift Package Manager. Please see the release notes for which version of LASDKiOS corresponds to the version of CBAAssist you wish to use.

Please make sure you reset your Swift Package Cache via ``File -> Packages -> Reset Package Cache`` so that Xcode will fetch the needed Packages for this Sample App to work.
